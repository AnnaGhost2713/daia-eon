        "To assess the fluency and language naturalness of the synthetic emails, we computed the pseudo-perplexity using a masked language model (bert-base-german-cased). This metric approximates how likely a language model considers the input text. Lower perplexity values indicate that the text is more probable (i.e., more natural or fluent), while higher values may point to uncommon or awkward constructions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our results were as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "Real Emails: 950.69 ± 6081.56\n",
        "\n",
        "Synthetic Emails: 1541.61 ± 8594.88\n",
        "\n",
        "These results show that the synthetic emails are moderately more perplexing for the language model than the real ones, with a ~1.6× higher mean. However, this gap is not extreme and suggests that the synthetic texts still largely resemble natural language. Both datasets exhibit high variance, which is expected given the heterogeneous structure and vocabulary of customer emails.\n",
        "\n",
        "Importantly, the high standard deviation on the synthetic set (±8594.88) indicates the presence of outliers—some generated samples that are likely less fluent or structurally atypical. This insight led us to investigate the least natural synthetic examples more closely, which can inform future improvements (e.g., filtering or refining placeholder substitution).\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the pseudo-perplexity analysis supports the conclusion that our synthetic dataset is relatively natural and comparable to real emails, though some outlier cases should be examined further."
