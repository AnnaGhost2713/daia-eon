    "# Span Overlap Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Detect and summarize overlapping labeled spans in one or more JSON datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inputs:**\n",
    "JSON samples with `labels` entries containing `start`, `end`, and `label` (and optional `text` for context).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outputs:**\n",
    "- Summary metrics: total overlaps, affected samples/datasets, severity breakdown, common label pairs.\n",
    "- Detailed overlap table (span pairs, overlap length/percent, snippet previews).\n",
    "- Visualizations: severity distribution, top label-pair overlaps, overlap lengths, dataset share.\n",
    "- Optional CSV export of all overlaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main flow:**\n",
    "1. Load dataset(s).\n",
    "2. Identify overlapping span pairs per sample and compute overlap details.\n",
    "3. Aggregate into summary statistics (including severity buckets and label-pair frequencies).\n",
    "4. Display summary and example overlaps per dataset.\n",
    "5. Build a DataFrame of all overlaps.\n",
    "6. Create visualizations.\n",
    "7. Save/export results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions:**\n",
    "- Overlap means spans share any character (exclusive end logic).\n",
    "- Severity is based on the maximum overlap percentage: <25% minor, 25‚Äì50% moderate, 50‚Äì75% major, >75% severe.\n",
    "- Malformed spans/labels are ignored gracefully."
